Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong,
West Virginia, Mountain mamma,
Take me home, сountry roads

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong,
West Virginia, Mountain mamma,
Take me home, сountry roads

All my memories gathered round her
Miners lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Teardrops in my eye
